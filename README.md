# GitHub Actions Learning Repository

Welcome to my GitHub Actions learning journey! This repository contains practical examples and workflows I've created while learning GitHub Actions from scratch.

## Learning Objectives

- Understanding GitHub Actions workflow syntax
- Learning different trigger types (push, pull request, manual)
- Exploring job configurations and steps
- Building practical automation workflows

## Workflow Examples

### 1. [Hello World Workflow](./workflows/hello-workflow.md)
- **File**: `.github/workflows/hello.yml`
- **Purpose**: Basic introduction to GitHub Actions
- **Triggers**: Push to main branch
- **What I learned**: Basic workflow structure, simple triggers

### 2. [Good Morning Workflow](./workflows/goodmorning-workflow.md)
- **File**: `.github/workflows/goodmorning.yml`
- **Purpose**: Advanced workflow with multiple jobs and triggers
- **Triggers**: Push, Pull Request, Manual dispatch
- **What I learned**: Multiple jobs, different trigger types, manual workflow execution

### 3. [Issue Comment Workflow](./workflows/issue-comment-workflow.md)
- **File**: `.github/workflows/issue-comment.yml`
- **Purpose**: Event-driven workflow triggered by issue comments
- **Triggers**: Issue comment creation
- **What I learned**: Event-driven automation, GitHub event context, issue comment handling

## Getting Started

1. **Clone this repository**
2. **Navigate to the Actions tab** in GitHub
3. **Explore the workflows** and their documentation
4. **Try the manual dispatch** feature for hands-on learning

## Learning Progress

- Basic workflow creation
